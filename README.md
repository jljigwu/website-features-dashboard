# Website features dashboard

## Business Task
This is dashboard that I create for my company(with changed data). It aim to offer a comprehensive view of various features present on comapny's websites. 

## Dataset

## Data Transformation
The source data is provided in a JSON file with a nested structure. To make it more manageable and suitable for analysis, I have used Python's pandas and json libraries to flatten the JSON structure. This ensures that each feature is represented as a separate column, making it easier to filter and analyze the data.
